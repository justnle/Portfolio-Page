ingredients) to a digital cabinet, and generate recipes based on
their selection. The recipes also get their caloric value
estimated. This web application was built with TheCocktailDB's API
and Nutritionix's API. A collaborative effort between classmate
[George Travis](https://agtravis.github.io/) and [Ari Horowitz](https://github.com/ariehh1).

A standard 0900 to 1700 work day planner that utilizes the
Moment.js library. This web app displays the hours in rows and
allows the user to save events to assist them in planning out
their day. The user can also schedule for future days and review
their schedules from the past, while the current day highlights
the current hour, placing emphasis on what events have passed and
which are upcoming.
